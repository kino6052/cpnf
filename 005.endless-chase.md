## **The Endless Chase and the Fixed‑Modulus Reduction**

### 4.1 The Endless Chase Scenario

At stage \(k\) of the twin‑sifting process, the certification window is  
\[
W_k = \Bigl\lfloor \frac{(\max B_k)^2-1}{6}\Bigr\rfloor .
\]

The endless chase is the hypothetical situation in which, after some stage \(K\), every admissible twin index lies outside the current certification window. Formally, for all \(k \ge K\),

\[
\min\{\,n\ge 1 \mid n \text{ is admissible for } B_k \,\} \;>\; W_k .
\]

If this occurred, the process would continue to expand the blocker set (by adding ordinary survivors when no twin is found) but would never again certify a new twin index. The window would grow, yet survivors would perpetually “run ahead” of it.

### 4.2 Why a Naïve Density Argument Fails

A natural first attempt to rule out the endless chase is to estimate the density of admissible twin indices.  
If the admissible residues were evenly distributed, the expected number of survivors in \([1,W_k]\) would be roughly

\[
W*k \prod*{p\in B_k}\Bigl(1-\frac{2}{p}\Bigr) \sim \frac{y_k^2}{(\log y_k)^2} \longrightarrow \infty,
\]

where \(y_k=\max B_k\). This suggests survivors should always be present.

However, the modulus \(M*k = \prod*{p\in B_k} p\) grows super‑exponentially with \(y_k\), while the window \(W_k\) grows only quadratically. Consequently, \(W_k\) is vanishingly small compared to the period \(M_k\) – far shorter than a single full cycle of the lattice. In such a regime, an average density does not guarantee that even one survivor actually falls inside the short interval. Converting the average into a rigorous existence statement would require strong, unproven equidistribution results about the admissible residues.

Thus, a simple density‑based viewpoint cannot eliminate the endless‑chase possibility with elementary means.

### 4.3 The Fixed‑Modulus Reduction: A Conceptual Shift

The key insight that dissolves the difficulty is the stage‑relative character of certification in CPNF. Once a twin index is certified at a stage, that certification remains valid forever, regardless of blockers added later. Therefore, when we ask whether a new twin can be certified after some stage \(k_0\), we are not forced to work with the ever‑growing modulus \(M_k\). Instead, we may freeze the modulus at the value

\[
M*0 = M*{k*0} = \prod*{p\in B\_{k_0}} p .
\]

Every admissible twin index after stage \(k_0\) must be congruent modulo \(M_0\) to one of the residues in

\[
R*0 = \{\, r\in[0,M_0-1] \mid \forall p\in B*{k_0},\; 6r\not\equiv\pm1\pmod p \,\}.
\]

When a new prime \(p\) (with \(p>\max B\_{k_0}\)) is added to the blocker set, the condition \(6n\not\equiv\pm1\pmod p\) removes two residue classes modulo \(p\); lifted to the fixed modulus \(M_0\), this eliminates exactly \(M_0/p\) residues from \(R_0\). Hence the set of residues that survive after introducing all new primes up to \(y\) has size at least

\[
|R*0| \prod*{\substack{p\le y\\ p\notin B\_{k_0}}}\Bigl(1-\frac{2}{p}\Bigr)
\;\sim\; |R_0| \,\frac{C}{(\log y)^2},
\]

where \(C\approx1.32\) is the twin‑prime constant. [[needs citation and explanation where this is from]]

The fixed‑modulus reduction transforms a dynamic sieve with an exponentially growing period into a static lattice problem. Now the period is the constant \(M_0\), and the thinning of admissible residues occurs only logarithmically. Meanwhile, the certification window grows as \(W(y)\sim y^2/6\). Once \(W(y)\) exceeds \(M_0\), the window contains many full periods of the lattice, and the average density becomes an effective lower bound (up to an error bounded by \(M_0\)).

### 4.4 A Heuristic Lower Bound via Sieve‑Theoretic Reasoning

To give a rigorous shape to the rate comparison outlined in §4.3, one could appeal to the **Fundamental Lemma of Sieve Theory** (Halberstam–Richert [1]), which treats sieves of dimension κ by means of a truncated inclusion‑exclusion.

In the CPNF setting the relevant sieve is of **dimension 2**: we remove exactly two residue classes (those satisfying \(6n\equiv\pm1\pmod p\)) for each prime \(p\le y\). For the range

\[
[1,\,W(y)],\qquad W(y)=\bigl\lfloor (y^{2}-1)/6\bigr\rfloor,
\]

the lemma provides explicit constants \(c*{1},c*{2}>0\) such that, for all sufficiently large \(y\),

\[
c*{1}\frac{W(y)}{(\log y)^{2}}
\;\le\;
\#\{\,n\le W(y)\mid \forall p\le y,\;6n\not\equiv\pm1\pmod p\,\}
\;\le\;
c*{2}\frac{W(y)}{(\log y)^{2}} .
\tag{3}
\]

The lower bound in (3) is deterministic; it depends only on the fact that two residue classes are removed per prime, not on any special distribution of those classes. Because \(W(y)\sim y^{2}/6\) grows quadratically while \((\log y)^{2}\) grows only logarithmically, the right‑hand side of (3) tends to infinity with \(y\).

A full verification of the lemma’s hypotheses lies outside the philosophical scope of this paper, but the structure of the CPNF sieve—fixed residue‑class removals, independent conditions for distinct primes—fits the standard framework exactly. Consequently, (3) supplies an unconditional guarantee that, for large enough \(y\), the certification window must contain many admissible twin indices.

### 4.5 Why the Endless Chase Cannot Occur

The growth‑rate comparison of §4.3, together with the sieve‑theoretic lower bound indicated in §4.4, rules out the endless‑chase scenario.

Once the modulus is frozen at an earlier stage (§4.3), the admissible indices form a union of arithmetic progressions with a fixed period \(M\_{0}\). The window length \(W(y)\) grows quadratically, while the thinning of those progressions (caused by adding new blockers) proceeds at a logarithmic pace. For sufficiently large \(y\) we therefore have

\[
W(y)\;\gg\;M\_{0},
\]

and the window must contain many full periods of the fixed lattice. The sieve‑theoretic estimate (3) then guarantees a positive—indeed, unbounded—number of survivors inside \([1,W(y)]\).

Hence there cannot be a stage after which all admissible indices forever lie outside the current window. The twin‑sifting process is forced to encounter new certifiable indices infinitely often; it can neither terminate nor stagnate permanently.

### 4.6 Philosophical and Methodological Reflection

The dissolution of the endless‑chase worry rests on three intertwined insights:

1. **Stage‑relativity of certification** – A twin index is certified relative to the blockers known at that moment; later additions do not invalidate earlier certifications. This allows us to “freeze” the modulus and work with a static lattice.
2. **Quadratic‑vs‑logarithmic growth** – The certification window expands as \(y^{2}\), while the density of admissible indices decays only as \(1/(\log y)^{2}\). This quantitative mismatch ensures that the window eventually overtakes any conceivable thinning.
3. **Availability of an unconditional sieve‑theoretic bound** – The Fundamental Lemma provides a rigorous lower bound for dimension‑2 sieves, turning the qualitative growth‑rate comparison into a proof that the window cannot remain empty.

Together, these points convert what might appear to be an intractable distributional problem (how survivors are placed within very short intervals) into a simple combinatorial fact: a sufficiently long interval must intersect a fixed periodic lattice.
