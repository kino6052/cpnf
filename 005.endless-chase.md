## **6. The Central Obstruction: The Endless Chase Scenario**

### **6.1 Formulating the Endless Chase**

The **endless chase** is the hypothetical scenario in which, after some stage \( K \), every admissible twin index lies _outside_ the current certification window \( W_k \) for all \( k \geq K \). Formally:

\[
\min\{\, n \geq 1 : n \text{ is admissible for } B_k \,\} > W_k \quad \text{for all } k \geq K.
\]

If this occurred, the process would run forever without certifying new twins—a form of permanent stagnation.

### **6.2 Why Density Arguments Are Insufficient**

A naïve density estimate suggests that the number of admissible indices in \( [1, W_k] \) grows like:

\[
W*k \prod*{p \in B_k} \left(1 - \frac{2}{p}\right) \sim \frac{y_k^2}{(\log y_k)^2} \to \infty.
\]

However, the modulus \( M*k = \prod*{p \in B_k} p \) grows super-exponentially, while \( W_k \) grows only quadratically. Thus \( W_k \) is vanishingly small compared to the period \( M_k \), and average density does not guarantee existence in such a short interval. A more delicate, structural argument is needed.

## **7. Fixed-Modulus Reduction: A Conceptual Shift**

### **7.1 Stage-Relative Certification and Modulus Freezing**

Certification in CPNF is **stage-relative**: a twin index certified at stage \( k \) is required only to survive the blockers present at that stage. Later additions to \( B \) do not retroactively invalidate earlier certifications. This allows us to **freeze** the modulus at an earlier stage \( k_0 \):

\[
M*0 = \prod*{p \in B\_{k_0}} p.
\]

### **7.2 From Dynamic Sieve to Static Lattice**

After freezing \( M*0 \), the set of admissible twin indices modulo \( M_0 \) is a fixed union of arithmetic progressions. Each new prime \( p > \max B*{k_0} \) removes at most two residue classes modulo \( p \), which translates to removing \( M_0/p \) residues modulo \( M_0 \). The thinning of admissible residues is thus **logarithmic** in \( y \), while the window \( W(y) \sim y^2/6 \) grows **quadratically**.

### **7.3 Growth Rate Comparison: Quadratic vs. Logarithmic**

This mismatch is decisive: for large \( y \), \( W(y) \) eventually exceeds \( M_0 \) many times over. The window then contains many full periods of the fixed lattice, making intersection with at least one admissible progression inevitable.

## **8. Why the Endless Chase Cannot Occur: An Unconditional Argument**

### **8.1 The Elementary Counting Strategy**

We now present an unconditional, elementary argument that rules out endless chase. The strategy is:

1. Fix the modulus \( M_0 \) at some stage \( k_0 \).
2. Count the number of admissible twin indices within the growing window \( W(y) \).
3. Show that this number eventually exceeds zero for all sufficiently large \( y \).

### **8.2 Key Lemmas**

**Lemma 1 (Effective Mertens-Type Bound).**  
There exists an explicit constant \( c > 0 \) such that for all \( y \ge 2 \),

\[
\prod\_{p \le y} \left(1 - \frac{2}{p}\right) \ge \frac{c}{(\log y)^2}.
\]

This follows from known effective bounds for Mertens products (e.g., Rosser & Schoenfeld, 1962), adapted for the factor \( 2 \).

**Lemma 2 (Surviving Residues in Fixed Lattice).**  
Let \( R*0 \) be the set of residues modulo \( M_0 \) that are admissible at stage \( k_0 \). For any \( y > \max B*{k_0} \), the set \( R_y \) of residues modulo \( M_0 \) that survive all blockers up to \( y \) satisfies:

\[
|R*y| \ge |R_0| \cdot \prod*{\substack{p \le y \\ p \notin B\_{k_0}}} \left(1 - \frac{2}{p}\right).
\]

**Lemma 3 (Counting in the Certification Window).**  
Let \( A(y, W) \) denote the set of twin indices \( n \le W \) that are admissible for all blockers \( \le y \). Then:

\[
|A(y, W)| \ge |R_y| \left( \left\lfloor \frac{W}{M_0} \right\rfloor - 1 \right).
\]

### **8.3 The Main Argument**

Combining the lemmas, we obtain:

\[
|A(y, W(y))| \ge |R*0| \cdot \prod*{\substack{p \le y \\ p \notin B\_{k_0}}} \left(1 - \frac{2}{p}\right) \cdot \left( \left\lfloor \frac{W(y)}{M_0} \right\rfloor - 1 \right).
\]

Using Lemma 1 and the fact that \( W(y) \sim y^2/6 \), we have:

\[
|A(y, W(y))| \ge \frac{c'}{(\log y)^2} \cdot \left( \frac{y^2}{6M_0} - 2 \right)
\]

for some constant \( c' > 0 \). The right-hand side tends to infinity with \( y \), so there exists an effectively computable \( Y \) such that for all \( y \ge Y \),

\[
|A(y, W(y))| \ge 1.
\]

### **8.4 Philosophical Significance**

This argument is:

- **Unconditional**: It relies only on elementary number theory and effective bounds.
- **Constructive**: It provides an explicit threshold beyond which certification is guaranteed.
- **Ontologically transparent**: It uses the fixed-modulus reduction to transform a dynamic problem into a static one, leveraging the stage-relativity of CPNF certification.

Thus, endless chase is impossible: the twin sifting process must certify new twins infinitely often.
