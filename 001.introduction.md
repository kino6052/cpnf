## Abstract

This paper presents the Computational Prime Number Framework (CPNF) as a case study in reframing classical number theory through a computational lens. In CPNF, primality emerges from a stagewise sifting process, which significantly simplifies infinitude arguments within the framework. We develop a sifting process and demonstrate that it can neither terminate nor stagnate in a state where it stops accumulating sieve survivors.

**Keywords:** Computational number theory, prime numbers, twin primes, sieve theory, Chinese Remainder Theorem, non-termination

## Important Notice

This paper is not claiming proofs to long-standing problems within classical number theory. This argument claims validity within its definitions, axioms and theorems.

## Methodological Note

This paper presents a conceptual framework and proof strategy rather than a complete formal proof. The computational prime number framework approach suggests a pathway to demonstrating complex infinitude arguments by analyzing process termination rather than counting primes. We identify where traditional methods encounter obstacles (the parity problem) and how computational reframing might circumvent them. The argument demonstrates conceptual coherence within computational prime number framework but acknowledges that full mathematical formalization requires additional work.

# Introduction

What follows is a selective historical outline used to frame this paper’s argument. The narrative is necessarily simplified. It emphasizes recurring ontological attitudes rather than providing a complete historical account. The goal is not to settle historical disputes, but to clarify how different conceptions of mathematical objects have shaped mathematical reasoning and practice.

## 1. Ancient Foundations: Mathematics as Practice and Meaning

Mathematics has accompanied humanity from its earliest known history. While basic counting has always been trivial, more elaborate mathematics has always required specialized skill and training.

In early civilizations—Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, and China—mathematics was closely tied to accounting, measurement, astronomy, and construction. Numbers were used to track physical quantities and organize social life. In this sense, mathematical entities functioned primarily as practical tools.

At the same time, numerological traditions emerged in many cultures. Numbers were often attributed symbolic or cosmological significance. In some contexts, numbers were thought to influence fate or reflect hidden order. These symbolic practices did not form a unified ontology, but they show that numbers were not always treated as mere instruments. Both practical and symbolic uses of number coexisted.

Non-numerological mathematical practice did not generally posit numbers as independently existing entities. Numbers counted crops, populations, and time cycles. They supported prediction and coordination. Mathematical meaning remained closely connected to use.

## 2. Greek Perspectives and Ontological Tension

Ancient Greece introduced a distinctive philosophical context for mathematics. Mathematical activity became intertwined with questions about knowledge, explanation, and reality. Many philosophers and mathematicians were citizens rather than priests. Philosophy and mathematics were part of a broader education in reasoning, rhetoric, and governance.

The Pythagorean school represented a different orientation. It combined mathematical study with religious and ethical aims. Its members held that the cosmos has an underlying numerical order. Mathematics, on this view, reveals that order. This orientation anticipates later Platonist interpretations, though it should not be equated with them without qualification.

Plato articulated a view in which mathematical objects are not sensible but are nevertheless objective. They are accessed through reason rather than perception. Mathematics thus points beyond empirical experience to a stable intelligible domain.

Aristotle rejected the independent existence of mathematical objects. He treated them as abstractions from sensible things. The geometer studies points, lines, and planes by mentally separating form from matter and motion. Mathematical entities, on this account, are not substances but abstractions dependent on physical reality.

Greek mathematics therefore exhibits a persistent tension between realist and constructive interpretations. This is especially visible in figures such as Euclid and Eratosthenes. Their work emphasizes construction, procedure, and finite reasoning. Primality is approached through explicit processes rather than appeal to completed infinite totalities. This paper aligns with that constructive orientation.

## 3. Medieval Contexts: Mathematics and Divine Order

In medieval Christian and Islamic contexts, mathematics was integrated into theological and philosophical education. It retained practical applications, but it was also understood as revealing a rational order established by God.

Influenced by Platonic and Neoplatonic sources, thinkers such as Augustine treated mathematical truths as grounded in the divine intellect. Numbers were necessary and eternal because God’s reason was necessary and eternal. Mathematical certainty mirrored divine constancy.

In this framework, mathematics was objective, but its objectivity was theological rather than metaphysically autonomous. Mathematical entities were not typically treated as human constructions, nor as independent abstract objects, but as reflections of divine order.

## 4. The Early Modern Shift

The Renaissance and early modern period brought renewed attention to mathematics as a tool for understanding nature. The recovery of classical texts, advances in mechanics, and the rise of experimental science strengthened the link between mathematics and physical explanation.

Figures such as Descartes and Newton treated space, time, and motion as mathematically structured features of the world. Mathematics appeared to describe reality itself, not merely our representations of it. This encouraged realist interpretations of mathematical objects, even when theological commitments varied.

Mathematics increasingly seemed independent of belief or tradition. Its success in prediction and control suggested access to objective structure.

## 5. Idealism and the Role of Human Cognition

Philosophical resistance to strong realism emerged alongside these developments. Berkeley criticized abstract mathematical entities as products of linguistic and cognitive practices. He argued that a general triangle cannot be imagined apart from specific features. Abstractions function as tools of reasoning, not as independently existing objects. He famously treated infinitesimals as useful fictions.

Kant offered a systematic alternative. In the Critique of Pure Reason, he argued that space, time, and number are not properties of things in themselves. They are forms of human sensibility. Mathematical knowledge is synthetic a priori. Its certainty arises from the mind’s constructive activity, not from metaphysical insight into an external realm.

On this view, mathematical necessity is grounded in the structure of human cognition. Mathematics remains objective and universal, but its source is transcendental rather than ontological. This marks a significant shift in how mathematical objects are understood.

## 6. Nineteenth- and Twentieth-Century Recommitments

Later mathematical developments challenged Kant’s framework. Non-Euclidean geometries undermined the identification of Euclidean space with necessary intuition. Analysis was arithmetized. Real numbers were constructed using set-theoretic methods.

Cantor’s work on infinite sets treated infinity as a completed totality. Different sizes of infinity were rigorously distinguished. These developments introduced entities that exceeded direct intuitive construction. Many mathematicians and philosophers interpreted this as support for a renewed realism about mathematical objects.

Frege argued that arithmetic presupposes objects. If arithmetic statements are true, then their objects must exist. This position rejected psychologism and intuition-based accounts. Mathematical objects were treated as timeless and independent of human cognition.

These views contributed to what is now often called mathematical Platonism. Mathematical entities are taken to exist independently of us. We discover them rather than create them. This stance became influential, even when not explicitly defended.

## 7. Contemporary Practice and Implicit Ontology

Contemporary philosophy of mathematics is pluralistic. It includes Platonist, structuralist, formalist, and constructive approaches. In practice, however, much mainstream mathematics relies on classical logic and standard set theory. These frameworks carry strong ontological commitments, even when practitioners avoid explicit metaphysical claims.

Arguments such as the Quine–Putnam indispensability thesis reinforce realist interpretations. Mathematics is indispensable to successful science. This is taken to support commitment to mathematical entities.

At the same time, many mathematicians treat ontological questions as secondary. They focus on technique and results. Ontological commitments are often implicit, embedded in the formal machinery rather than openly examined.

## 8. This Project: Ontology through CPNF

This paper does not aim to resolve long-standing metaphysical disputes. Instead, it examines how ontological commitments shape mathematical practice through a concrete case study.

We introduce the **Computational Prime Number Framework (CPNF)**. In CPNF, primes are not defined as elements of a completed infinite set. They are certified through a finite, step-by-step filtering process. Each stage applies explicit divisibility tests. Survivors at each stage generate further tests.

Primality is grounded in computation and process non-termination, not in prior commitment to completed infinitary objects. This avoids assuming an actual infinite totality while remaining formally precise.

CPNF echoes classical constructive approaches found in Euclid and Eratosthenes. It also resonates with Kantian themes, where construction plays a central role, and with Berkeleyan caution toward reification. The framework does not deny that numbers exist. It brackets that question and focuses on how mathematical concepts function within disciplined procedures.

Within CPNF, questions about infinitude are reformulated. They concern whether a process terminates or stabilizes. They do not require appeal to pre-given infinite collections. This shift alters how proofs are structured and how results are interpreted.

The claim of this paper is methodological. Ontological framing influences what counts as a legitimate argument and what strategies are available. By making these commitments explicit, alternative forms of reasoning become visible.

### Scope and Contribution of This Paper

This paper presents CPNF as a case study in the relationship between ontology and mathematical practice. Specifically, it will:

1. Formally describe the Computational Prime Number Framework.
2. Extend the framework to twin primes by treating infinitude as process non-termination.
3. Introduce the fixed-modulus reduction and show that the twin-prime certification process cannot terminate.
4. Argue that this result depends on a constructive, process-oriented ontology.

This paper does not claim to resolve the classical twin prime conjecture. It shows that when the problem is reframed procedurally, questions of infinitude become coherent in a different way.

The broader implication is methodological. If mathematical practice is sensitive to ontological assumptions, then explicit reflection on those assumptions may open new avenues of reasoning. Mathematics can be understood not only as the study of abstract objects, but as the disciplined exploration of what structured reasoning entails.
