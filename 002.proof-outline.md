## **Proof Strategy Outline**

This paper outlines the Computational Prime Number Framework (CPNF) as a methodological case study, and the proof strategy is correspondingly structured around process analysis rather than object counting. The central question throughout is not whether certain sets are large, but whether explicitly defined certification procedures can terminate or enter permanent stagnation. The argument unfolds in four logically distinct parts.

### **Overview**

The overall strategy is to:

- Reformulate classical infinitude questions as termination problems for deterministic, stagewise processes.
- Isolate the sole nontrivial obstruction to such arguments (the “endless chase” scenario).
- Resolve this obstruction using elementary modular arithmetic and a fixed-modulus counting argument.
- Argue that such significant simplification of the argument relied on the ontological comittments assumed for prime numbers

Each part of the paper plays a precise role in this program.

#### **Part I: Ordinary Primes as a Certification Process**

The first part establishes the baseline framework by reformulating ordinary primality within CPNF.

- The paper provides a definition of a stagewise sieve in which primes are certified sequentially as minimal survivors of a deterministic filtering process.
- A blocker set accumulates previously certified primes and is used to eliminate composite candidates.
- Two elementary results are established:

  1. **Soundness**: no composite number can ever be certified.
  2. **Non-termination**: the process cannot exhaust all candidates.

The non-termination proof mirrors Euclid’s classical argument but is expressed entirely in terms of process continuation. This serves two purposes: it validates CPNF against a well-understood case, and it demonstrates how infinitude naturally appears as inexhaustibility of a procedure, not as a statement about a completed set.

#### **Part II: Twin Primes and the Certification Window**

The second part extends the framework to twin primes, introducing additional structure and the paper’s central difficulty.

- Twin prime candidates are represented via twin indices (n), corresponding to the pair ((6n-1,6n+1)).
- Certification now requires simultaneous survival of two correlated candidates, which necessitates a certification window ensuring correctness at the moment of certification.
- A twin sifting process is defined, alternating between:
  - certifying new twin indices when possible, and
  - expanding the blocker set with additional ordinary blockers when no certification is currently available.

At this point, the ordinary Euclidean non-termination argument no longer applies directly. The introduction of a certification window creates the possibility of stagnation (no new twin index ever added) even as the process continues.

---

#### **The Central Obstruction: The Endless Chase**

The core technical concern of the paper is the endless chase scenario:

> Could it happen that, after some finite stage, all admissible twin indices lie permanently outside the certification window, so that no new twin can ever be certified, despite continued growth of the blocker set?

This is the only point at which the framework risks failure. If such a scenario were possible, the twin-sifting process could run indefinitely without producing new certified twins, undermining the reformulation of infinitude as non-termination.

The remainder of Part II is devoted exclusively to ruling out this scenario.

---

#### **Fixed-Modulus Reduction: The Key Technical Idea**

The resolution of the endless chase relies on a single conceptual move: the fixed-modulus reduction.

- Certification in CPNF is stage-relative and irreversible: once a twin index is certified, later blockers do not invalidate it.
- Consequently, when analyzing progress beyond a given stage (k_0), we may freeze the modulus at the product of blockers known at that stage.
- Subsequent blockers thin the set of admissible residues modulo this fixed modulus in a strictly controlled, multiplicative way: each new blocker removes at most two residue classes.

This reduction transforms the problem from one about distribution in extremely short intervals relative to a rapidly growing modulus into a finite combinatorial problem on a fixed periodic lattice.

---

#### **Part III: Elimination of the Endless Chase**

With the modulus fixed:

- The certification window grows quadratically with the largest blocker.
- The thinning of admissible residues occurs only logarithmically.
- Elementary counting arguments then provide a heuristic (conditional argument) showing that, beyond some stage, the window must intersect at least one admissible arithmetic progression.
- For non-conditional argument, the paper provides an argument that a fundamental lemma with truncated inclusion-exclusion helps to determine the lower bound for survivors guarnateing existence at some point in the process inside the window

This establishes that:

- the certification window cannot remain permanently empty,
- permanent stagnation is impossible, and
- the twin-sifting process must continue to certify new twin indices indefinitely.

---

**Part IV**

- To provide philosophical insights on why this computational reformulation is effective and how it shifts the ontological perspective.
- To explain why the analysis of the endless chase is the only challenging part of the argument.
- We then discuss why this rate-based, process-oriented argument may not yet be accepted as a fully rigorous proof by all standards, yet it constitutes a compelling and coherent logical argument within the well-defined CPNF framework.
