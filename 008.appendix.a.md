## Appendix A: Sieve-Theoretic Argument Using the Fundamental Lemma

This appendix presents an alternative argument ruling out the endless chase using the Fundamental Lemma of Sieve Theory. While more technical than the structural uniformity argument, it provides quantitative bounds that may be of independent interest.

### A.1 Setup

We work within the same fixed-modulus framework as in Section 4.4. Let \(M*0\), \(R_0\), and \(Q\) be as defined. For any \(y > 0\), let \(Q(y) = \{q \in Q \mid q \leq y\}\), and define
\[
S(y) = \{\, r \in R_0 \mid \forall q \in Q(y),\; 6r \not\equiv \pm 1 \pmod q \,\}.
\]
The set of admissible twin indices at sieving level \(y\) is
\[
A(y) = \bigcup*{r \in S(y)} \{\, r + t M*0 \mid t \in \mathbb{Z}*{\geq 0} \,\}.
\]

### A.2 Applying the Fundamental Lemma

Consider the sifting problem restricted to the arithmetic progression \(R_0 + M_0\mathbb{Z}\). For each prime \(q \leq y\), we remove those \(n\) in this progression for which \(6n \equiv \pm 1 \pmod{q}\). Since \(\gcd(q, M_0) = 1\), this condition eliminates exactly \(2/q\) of the elements in the progression.

The Fundamental Lemma of Sieve Theory (Halberstam–Richert [1, Corollary 6.10]) applies to such regular sieve problems. For our dimension-2 sieve (each prime removes proportion \(2/q\)), there exist constants \(c_1, c_2 > 0\) such that for all sufficiently large \(y\),
\[
c_1 \cdot \frac{|R_0|}{M_0} \cdot \frac{W(y)}{(\log y)^2}
\leq \#\{\, n \leq W(y) : n \bmod M_0 \in R_0 \text{ and } \forall q \leq y,\ 6n \not\equiv \pm 1 \pmod q \,\}
\leq c_2 \cdot \frac{|R_0|}{M_0} \cdot \frac{W(y)}{(\log y)^2},
\]
where \(W(y) = \lfloor (y^2 - 1)/6 \rfloor\).

The crucial observation is that the Fundamental Lemma applies **unconditionally** to sieves on arithmetic progressions when the sieving conditions are periodic and regular. The condition that each prime \(q\) removes exactly two residue classes modulo \(q\) ensures the sieve has dimension 2, and the Chinese Remainder Theorem guarantees independence across primes.

### A.3 Consequences for the Endless Chase

From the lower bound, we obtain:
\[
\#(A(y) \cap [1, W(y)]) \geq c_1 \cdot \frac{|R_0|}{M_0} \cdot \frac{W(y)}{(\log y)^2}.
\]
Since \(W(y) \sim y^2/6\) grows quadratically while \((\log y)^2\) grows only logarithmically, the right-hand side tends to infinity with \(y\). Therefore, for all sufficiently large \(y\),
\[
\#(A(y) \cap [1, W(y)]) \geq 1.
\]

Thus, the endless chase scenario—where \(W(y)\) contains no admissible indices for all sufficiently large \(y\)—is impossible.

### A.4 Comparison with the Structural Argument

The sieve-theoretic argument provides explicit constants and quantitative bounds, but at the cost of requiring more advanced machinery. The structural uniformity argument (Section 4.4) achieves the same conclusion through simpler combinatorial reasoning but provides less quantitative information.

Both arguments share the same logical structure:

1. Fix the modulus \(M_0\) at an early stage
2. Observe that admissible indices form arithmetic progressions modulo \(M_0\)
3. Show that these progressions must intersect sufficiently large intervals

The sieve-theoretic approach uses analytic bounds to establish intersection, while the structural approach uses the pigeonhole principle and properties of arithmetic progressions.

IS this better?

## Clarification on Certification Dynamics: Addressing the Endless Deferral Concern

We thank the critic for identifying a subtle but important gap in our original formulation of Lemma B.2. The objection is correct: a **global counting argument** alone cannot guarantee certification, because admissibility is stage‑relative and non‑monotonic. New blockers can eliminate previously admissible indices, so the mere fact that many admissible indices exist at some stage does not force the process to certify a new one.

This section provides a **pointwise stabilization argument** that closes the gap. The core idea is that any specific twin index can be eliminated only by finitely many primes, so after those primes are added (if ever), the index becomes **permanently admissible** and must eventually be certified.
