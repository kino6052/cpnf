## Conclusion

The Computational Prime Number Framework demonstrates how ontological choices can reshape mathematical problems. By treating primality as a certification process rather than a static property, and infinitude as non-termination rather than cardinality, CPNF enables new proof strategies that bypass traditional obstacles like the parity problem.

The fixed-modulus reduction, in particular, transforms the twin prime problem from an asymptotic density question into a combinatorial lattice problem. Both the structural uniformity argument (Section 4.4) and the sieve-theoretic argument confirm that within this framework, the endless chase scenario is impossible, establishing the infinitude of twin primes as a consequence of process non-termination.

While CPNF does not resolve the classical twin prime conjecture in its traditional formulation, it offers a coherent alternative framework where the problem becomes tractable through computational principles. This suggests that explicit philosophical reflection on mathematical ontology may yield practical benefits for mathematical practice, offering new pathways where traditional methods encounter barriers.
