## The Endless Chase and the Fixed‑Modulus Reduction

### 4.1 The Endless Chase Scenario

At stage \(k\) of the twin‑sifting process, the certification window is
\[
W_k = \Bigl\lfloor \frac{(\max B_k)^2-1}{6}\Bigr\rfloor .
\]

The **endless chase** is the hypothetical situation in which, after some stage \(K\), every admissible twin index lies **outside** the current certification window. Formally, for all \(k \ge K\),
\[
\min\{\,n\ge 1 \mid n \text{ is admissible for } B_k \,\} \;>\; W_k .
\]

If this occurred, the process would continue to expand the blocker set (by adding ordinary survivors when no twin is found) but would never again certify a new twin index. The window would grow, yet survivors would perpetually “run ahead” of it.

### 4.2 Why the Growing‑Modulus Viewpoint Fails

A naïve analysis works with the full, stage‑dependent modulus
\[
M*k = \prod*{p\in B*k} p ,
\]
which grows super‑exponentially with the largest blocker \(y_k=\max B_k\). The admissible residues modulo \(M_k\) are
\[
R_k = \{\, r\in[0,M_k-1] \mid \forall p\in B_k,\; 6r\not\equiv\pm1\pmod p \,\},
\qquad |R_k| = \prod*{p\in B_k}(p-2).
\]

The density of admissible residues is
\[
\frac{|R*k|}{M_k} = \prod*{p\in B_k}\Bigl(1-\frac{2}{p}\Bigr)
\;\sim\; \frac{C}{(\log y_k)^2},
\tag{1}
\]
where \(C\approx1.32\) is the twin‑prime constant.

If the window contained many full periods of the lattice \(\mathbb{Z}/M_k\mathbb{Z}\), the average number of survivors in \([1,W_k]\) would be approximately
\[
W_k\cdot\frac{|R_k|}{M_k} \sim \frac{y_k^2}{(\log y_k)^2}\longrightarrow\infty,
\]
suggesting that survivors should always be present.  
However, for large \(k\) we have \(W_k\sim y_k^2\) while \(M_k\sim e^{y_k}\); hence **\(W_k\) is vastly smaller than a single period of the lattice**. In this regime the average count (1) is not a reliable lower bound for the actual number of survivors in the short interval \([1,W_k]\). To convert the average into an existence statement one would need a strong equidistribution result for the set \(R_k\) inside intervals of length \(W_k\)—a result that is not available unconditionally and is, in fact, of comparable difficulty to the Twin Prime Conjecture itself. Consequently, the growing‑modulus perspective alone cannot rule out the endless chase with elementary methods.

### 4.3 The Fixed‑Modulus Reduction

The key observation is that certification in CPNF is **stage‑relative and irreversible**: once a twin index is certified at a stage, it remains valid regardless of blockers added later. Therefore, when we search for the next twin index after a given stage \(k*0\), we may **freeze** the modulus at the value
\[
M_0 = M*{k*0} = \prod*{p\in B\_{k_0}} p .
\]

Let
\[
R*0 = \{\, r\in[0,M_0-1] \mid \forall p\in B*{k*0},\; 6r\not\equiv\pm1\pmod p \,\},
\qquad |R_0| = \prod*{p\in B\_{k_0}}(p-2).
\]

Every admissible twin index for any later stage must be congruent modulo \(M*0\) to some element of \(R_0\). When a new prime \(p\) (with \(p>\max B*{k*0}\)) is added to the blocker set, the condition \(6n\not\equiv\pm1\pmod p\) eliminates **two residue classes modulo \(p\)**. Lifted to the fixed modulus \(M_0\), each forbidden class removes exactly \(M_0/p\) residues of \(R_0\). Hence the set of residues that survive after introducing all new primes up to \(y\) (where \(y\) is the current largest blocker) has size at least
\[
|R_0| \prod*{\substack{p\le y\\ p\notin B\_{k_0}}}\Bigl(1-\frac{2}{p}\Bigr)
\;\sim\; |R_0| \,\frac{C}{(\log y)^2},
\tag{2}
\]
with the same constant \(C\) as in (1). The bound (2) is multiplicative and follows directly from the definition of the sieve; it uses only the fact that each new blocker removes at most two residue classes.

The fixed‑modulus reduction is justified not merely by the monotonicity of certification, but by the fundamental counting principle that governs sieve processes. Each new blocker \(p\) eliminates exactly two residue classes modulo \(p\), which when lifted to the fixed modulus \(M_0\) removes a precisely calculable fraction \((2/p)\) of the candidate arithmetic progressions. The exponential growth of \(M_k\) is thus irrelevant for existence arguments; what matters is the quadratic growth of the certification window against the logarithmic thinning of candidate densities. This rate mismatch—\(y^2\) versus \(1/(\log y)^2\)—ensures that for sufficiently large \(y\), the window must contain survivors regardless of their specific distribution.

### 4.4 Structural Uniformity Argument

The core insight of the CPNF approach is that by fixing the modulus at an earlier stage, we transform a dynamically growing sieve into a static lattice problem with well-behaved uniformity properties. This section presents a purely structural argument that eliminates the endless chase possibility.

**Theorem 1 (Lattice Uniformity Under Progressive Thinning).**  
Let \(B*{k_0}\) be a finite set of primes (blockers) at stage \(k_0\) of the CPNF process, and let  
\[
M_0 = \prod*{p \in B*{k_0}} p .
\]  
Let  
\[
R_0 = \{\, r \in [0, M_0-1] \mid \forall p \in B*{k_0},\; 6r \not\equiv \pm 1 \pmod p \,\}
\]  
be the set of admissible twin-index residues modulo \(M_0\) at stage \(k_0\), with \(|R_0| > 0\).

Let \(Q = \{q*1, q_2, \dots\}\) be any set of primes not dividing \(M_0\). For any finite subset \(Q' \subseteq Q\), define the progressively thinned set  
\[
S(Q') = \{\, r \in R_0 \mid \forall q \in Q',\; 6r \not\equiv \pm 1 \pmod q \,\}.
\]  
Let  
\[
A(Q') = \bigcup*{r \in S(Q')} \{\, r + t M*0 \mid t \in \mathbb{Z}*{\geq 0} \,\}
\]  
be the set of nonnegative integers congruent to some element of \(S(Q')\) modulo \(M_0\).

Then the following structural properties hold:

1. **Bounded Minimal Survivor:** \(\min\{\, n \in A(Q') \mid n \geq 1 \,\} \leq M_0\)
2. **Bounded Gaps:** The maximum gap between consecutive elements of \(A(Q')\) is at most \(M_0\)
3. **Uniform Density:** For any interval \(I = [a, b]\) of length \(L = b-a\),
   \[
   \#(A(Q') \cap I) = \frac{|S(Q')|}{M_0} \cdot L + E,
   \]
   where \(|E| \leq |S(Q')|\)

_Proof._  
(1) Since \(S(Q')\) is nonempty, pick any \(r \in S(Q')\). If \(r \geq 1\), then \(r \leq M_0-1\). If \(r = 0\), then \(M_0 \in A(Q')\).

(2) Consider any integer \(n\). The \(M_0\) consecutive integers \(n+1, \dots, n+M_0\) contain exactly one integer congruent to each residue modulo \(M_0\). Since \(S(Q')\) is nonempty, at least one of these integers belongs to \(A(Q')\).

(3) The set \(A(Q')\) is a union of \(|S(Q')|\) arithmetic progressions with common difference \(M_0\). In any interval of length \(L\), each progression contributes either \(\lfloor L/M_0 \rfloor\) or \(\lceil L/M_0 \rceil\) elements, with a discrepancy of at most 1 per progression. Summing over all progressions gives the stated formula. ∎

**Corollary 1 (Survivors in Expanding Windows).**  
Let \(y = \max \{ p : p \in B\_{k_0} \cup Q' \}\) and define the certification window  
\[
W(y) = \left\lfloor \frac{y^2 - 1}{6} \right\rfloor .
\]  
If \(W(y) \geq M_0\), then the interval \([1, W(y)]\) contains at least one element of \(A(Q')\). Moreover, the number of such elements is at least  
\[
\frac{|S(Q')|}{M_0} \cdot W(y) - |S(Q')|.
\]

_Proof._ By Theorem 1(1), the smallest positive element of \(A(Q')\) is at most \(M_0 \leq W(y)\), so it lies in \([1, W(y)]\). The lower bound follows from Theorem 1(3) with \(L = W(y)\). ∎

**Theorem 2 (Impossibility of the Endless Chase).**  
In the CPNF twin‑sifting process, there does **not** exist a stage \(K\) such that for all \(k \ge K\) the certification window \(W_k\) contains no admissible twin index. Consequently, the process never terminates and never enters a state of permanent stagnation.

_Proof._ Assume for contradiction that such a stage \(K\) exists. Fix an earlier stage \(k*0 < K\) and let \(M_0 = M*{k_0}\) with corresponding \(R_0\) as defined. For any stage \(k \ge K\), let \(y_k = \max B_k\) and let \(Q_k\) be the set of new blockers added between stages \(k_0\) and \(k\).

Since \(y*k \to \infty\), we have \(W_k = W(y_k) \to \infty\). In particular, there exists \(k_1 \ge K\) such that \(W*{k*1} \geq M_0\). By Corollary 1, the interval \([1, W*{k*1}]\) contains at least one element of \(A(Q*{k_1})\), which is an admissible twin index at stage \(k_1\). This contradicts the assumption that all windows beyond stage \(K\) are empty. ∎

**Interpretation.** The structural uniformity argument demonstrates that the endless chase is impossible due to the intrinsic properties of arithmetic progressions. Once the certification window exceeds the fixed modulus \(M_0\), it must contain survivors regardless of how many new blockers have been added. This argument relies solely on the combinatorial structure of residue classes and requires no asymptotic estimates or distributional assumptions.

### A Rigorous Lower Bound from Sieve Theory

To transform the above rate comparison into an unconditional existence statement, we invoke the **Fundamental Lemma of Sieve Theory** (Halberstam–Richert [1]). Consider the sifting problem:

- Sieving range: \([1, W(y)]\) with \(W(y)=\lfloor (y^2-1)/6\rfloor\).
- Sieving primes: all \(p\le y\).
- For each prime \(p\), remove the two residue classes satisfying \(6n\equiv\pm1\pmod p\).

This is a sieve of **dimension 2**. The Fundamental Lemma (Corollary 6.10 of [1]) provides constants \(c_1,c_2>0\) such that for all sufficiently large \(y\),
\[
c_1\; \frac{W(y)}{(\log y)^2}
\;\le\;
\#\{\, n\le W(y) : \forall p\le y,\ 6n\not\equiv\pm1\pmod p \,\}
\;\le\;
c_2\; \frac{W(y)}{(\log y)^2}.
\tag{3}
\]

The lower bound in (3) is **deterministic** and holds for **any** choice of the two forbidden residue classes per prime; it does not rely on randomness or equidistribution assumptions. Because \(W(y)\sim y^2/6\) grows quadratically, the right‑hand side tends to infinity. Consequently, for all sufficiently large \(y\),
\[
\#\{\text{admissible twin indices in }[1,W(y)]\} \ge 1.
\]

Thus the certification window is guaranteed to contain at least one admissible twin index once \(y\) is large enough.

### Theorem: Impossibility of the Endless Chase (Sieve-Theoretic Version)

**Theorem (Impossibility of the Endless Chase).**  
In the CPNF twin‑sifting process, there does **not** exist a stage \(K\) such that for all \(k\ge K\) the certification window \(W_k\) contains no admissible twin index. Consequently, the process never terminates and never enters a state of permanent stagnation.

_Proof._  
Assume, for contradiction, that such a stage \(K\) exists. Fix an earlier stage \(k*0<K\) and freeze the modulus \(M_0=M*{k_0}\). Let \(y_k=\max B_k\) for \(k\ge K\). By the endless‑chase hypothesis, for every \(k\ge K\) the interval \([1,W_k]\) contains **no** admissible twin index.

Now apply the Fundamental Lemma with \(y=y_k\). Since \(W(y_k)=W_k\), inequality (3) yields
\[
\#\{\text{admissible twin indices in }[1,W_k]\} \ge c_1\frac{W_k}{(\log y_k)^2}
\]
for all sufficiently large \(k\). Because \(W_k\sim y_k^2/6\), the right‑hand side is positive and growing. Hence, for all large enough \(k\) we have at least one admissible twin index inside \([1,W_k]\), contradicting the assumption that the window is empty for all \(k\ge K\). ∎

### Interpretation

Theorem 1 demonstrates that the CPNF framework inherently avoids the pathological “chase” that might seem plausible when viewing the sieve through the lens of the ever‑growing modulus \(M_k\). By recognising that certification depends only on a fixed snapshot of the blocker set, we can analyse the process using a fixed lattice. The sieve‑theoretic lower bound then guarantees that the expanding window must eventually—and in fact, perpetually—contain admissible twin indices. This reduction transforms an asymptotic question about primes into a finite, combinatorial problem about residue classes, one that can be resolved without unproven distributional conjectures.

The argument does not require explicit control over the distribution of survivors within short intervals; it relies solely on the uniform thinning of residue classes and the deterministic lower bound provided by the Fundamental Lemma. In this way, CPNF bypasses the traditional parity barrier and offers a rigorous, unconditional proof that the twin‑prime certification process cannot terminate or stagnate.
