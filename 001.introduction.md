## Abstract

This paper presents the Computational Prime Number Framework (CPNF) as a case study in reframing classical number theory through a computational lens. In CPNF, primality emerges from a stagewise sifting process, which significantly simplifies infinitude arguments within the framework. We develop a sifting process and demonstrate that it can neither terminate nor stagnate in a state where it stops accumulating sieve survivors.

**Keywords:** Computational number theory, prime numbers, twin primes, sieve theory, Chinese Remainder Theorem, non-termination

## Important Notice

This paper is not claiming proofs to long-standing problems within classical number theory. This argument claims validity within its definitions, axioms and theorems.

## Methodological Note

This paper presents a conceptual framework and proof strategy rather than a complete formal proof. The computational prime number framework approach suggests a pathway to demonstrating complex infinitude arguments by analyzing process termination rather than counting primes. We identify where traditional methods encounter obstacles (the parity problem) and how computational reframing might circumvent them. The argument demonstrates conceptual coherence within computational prime number framework but acknowledges that full mathematical formalization requires additional work.

# Introduction

What follows is a brief outline of the historical narrative assumed by this paper. This narrative is simplified and may miss nuances, but it provides necessary context for the broader argument about mathematical ontology and its evolution. This paper does not claim full historical accuracy, only that this account is valid within the scope of its argument.

## 1. Ancient Foundations: Mathematics as Divine Order and Practical Art

Mathematics has accompanied humanity from its earliest known history. Basic counting is trivial. More elaborate mathematics, however, has always been the domain of the few, requiring aptitude and skill.

In early civilizations (Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, China), mathematics was tied to accounting for physical objects. Yet numerology—attributing divine properties to numbers—has also existed since civilization's dawn. Early number ontology seems contradictory. On one hand, numbers described everyday things. On the other, numbers held magical power; their very name could affect one's life, as if they were spirits or recognized by the spirit world. This persists today globally, notably in China.

The non-numerological treatment of numbers did not attribute independent ontology to them. Numbers accounted for crops, population, and temple construction. They made astronomical calendars.

## 2. Prominent Perspectives from Ancient Greece

The Greeks present an interesting case. Many philosophers and mathematicians were not priests but citizens, like Socrates. They practiced philosophy and rhetoric as part of a wealthy citizen's education, which included governance and speech refinement. Sophism and reactions to it created a competitive environment for correct argument.

The Pythagorean school, however, was different. It was a cult seeking purification through knowledge to unite with the cosmos. They believed the cosmos had a mathematical order. Mathematics thus revealed this order. This is essentially a Platonic perspective.

The Platonic view will be emphasized in this paper. We do not claim it is false a priori. We claim it transcends experience and involves a reification that is not philosophically careful. Positing such reality creates serious ontological commitments and, as this paper shows, serious consequences.

Aristotle argued against the independent ontology of numbers. He treated them as abstractions from sensible things. For Aristotle, the geometer studies points, lines, and planes not as concrete bodies but via mental "separation" from motion and matter. Mathematical entities were "abstractions from perceptible sublunary beings," not independent substances.

The most important figures for this paper are Eratosthenes and Euclid. They viewed primality through a process of construction and made constructive arguments. This paper commits to that approach.

## 3. The Medieval Synthesis: Mathematics under Theology

With the rise of Christianity and Islam, mathematics entered the curriculum of clergy and nobility. It remained practical. Non-practical arguments were part of philosophical discourse, which served to apologize for faith. Mathematics was seen as an extension of logic and philosophy serving apologetic purposes. Ontology again aligned with Platonism—the realm of divine order, the divine mind, accessible to humans made in God's image. Augustine of Hippo "Christianized" Plato by identifying the eternal Logos with mathematical truth. For him, number and wisdom were one, existing in the mind of God. Mathematical necessity mirrored God's constant reason.

## 4. The Early Modern Turn

The Renaissance and Enlightenment brought a new ontological shift. Recovery of classical texts, advances in mechanics and philosophy, and the rise of the experimental method suggested the world was regular and its regularities mathematically describable. This description seemed independent of belief. Knowledge of these regularities offered predictive power and advantage. Isaac Newton and Descartes believed in absolute space and time, an ontological commitment about the world and mathematics. Mathematics became a feature of the world itself, independent of us—a return to Platonic views.

## 5. Idealism and Human Reason

Despite the historical dominance of Platonism, there were shifts.

George Berkeley was an early philosopher who found ontological commitments problematic. He argued that abstractions like an equilateral triangle cannot be imagined except by manipulating abstractions—a language game, not ontologically real things. A concrete triangle exists; a triangle as such does not, being an abstraction. Abstractions relate to mental faculties, not to independent existence. Berkeley famously criticized the reification of infinitesimals as useful fictions.

For Kant, in his _Critique of Pure Reason_, space, time, and number were not properties of God’s mind or things-in-themselves. They were forms of human sensibility. Geometry and arithmetic were synthetic a priori disciplines: their concepts were constructed by the mind's pure intuitions. To understand a triangle, one must "exhibit a priori the intuition corresponding to it." Mathematical knowledge arose from the mind's active construction. For Kant, space and time were innate cognitive frameworks. Geometric truths were true by virtue of the mind's own structure. Mathematics remained certain, but its necessity was grounded in human reason, not metaphysics. Kant anthropocentrized mathematics. Mathematical objects became part of the transcendental architecture of human knowledge, not independent divine realities. This was a significant ontological shift.

## 6. The 19th–20th Century: Rise of Non-Anthropomorphic Platonism

Kant’s cognitive turn proved unstable amid 19th-century mathematical revolutions. Non-Euclidean geometries shattered the idea that Euclid's geometry was necessary spatial structure. Analysts arithmetized analysis, constructing real numbers from integers via set theory. Georg Cantor treated infinite sets as completed totalities, showing different sizes of infinity were legitimate mathematical objects. These developments introduced entities—non-Euclidean spaces, actual infinities—beyond direct human intuition. **This was a decisive moment. Cantor and others made explicit, bold ontological commitments. They posited a reality of abstract, completed infinite objects.**

These advances led mathematicians to return to the view of mathematics as part of a separate, independent world we access. In modern Platonism, mathematical statements are made true by objectively existing abstract objects (numbers, sets, functions). For Frege, since arithmetic language presupposes objects and its theorems are true, we must accept those abstract objects exist. This Platonism was explicitly non-psychologistic. It denied a causal or intuitive link between human thought and mathematical existence. Mathematical objects were acausal, timeless entities we "discover." As one summary states, mathematical truths are about structures "independent of us and our language, thought, and practices." This view became default among many mathematicians and philosophers. **The legacy of Cantor’s ontological commitments became the unspoken foundation.**

## 7. The Contemporary Landscape: Ontology as Practical Choice

Today's philosophy of mathematics is pluralistic, but debates often assume a broadly Platonist or structuralist framework. The dominant slogan is that "mathematics is the general study of structures." What matters are abstract relations, not humanly-constructed carriers. In practice, most mathematicians speak as if uncovering a world of abstract groups, spaces, and fields whose existence is independent of us. The indispensability argument of Quine and Putnam supports this: mathematics is essential to our best scientific theories, so we should be ontologically committed to mathematical entities as we are to electrons.

**Crucially, modern mathematicians often try to avoid explicit ontological commitments. They focus on formalism and practice. Yet the frameworks they use—standard set theory, classical logic—carry the implicit ontological commitments of Cantor and Frege. These commitments are philosophically problematic but are buried in the machinery.** Alternative viewpoints persist. Constructive and intuitionist schools (Kronecker, Bishop) ground mathematics in mental activity or computability. Yet the dominant "realist" narrative—that our minds evolved shaped by reality, conforming to its patterns—subconsciously influences ontological commitments in mathematics. Mathematics is seen as the fundamental pattern allowing generalization, better adaptation, and survival.

## 8. This Project: Reassessing Ontology through CPNF

This paper does not resolve classical metaphysical disputes. It examines them through a concrete, practice-oriented lens. We study the Computational Prime Number Framework (CPNF), where prime numbers are treated as invariants of algorithmic processes. In CPNF, a "prime" is defined by a step-by-step filtering (sieving) process. One repeatedly applies simple divisibility filters to natural numbers. Each stage's "survivors" give the next primes.

Primality is certified by finite computation and the sieve's non-termination, not by membership in a pre-given, completed infinite set. **This deliberately avoids the implicit ontological commitment to a completed infinite totality, a commitment inherited from Cantor.**

This perspective echoes Euclid and Eratosthenes. CPNF conceives mathematical objects as given by disciplined processes, not as completed infinite wholes. It uses modern formality: every sieve step is precise. CPNF revives Kantian ideas (constructive methods generate truth) with Berkeleyan dereification (refusing to posit metaphysically heavy infinitary objects). We do not claim this settles whether numbers "really exist." We argue CPNF offers a coherent framework for number theory by focusing on processes. Questions about primality and infinity are recast in terms of dynamic procedures: Will the sieve reach a contradiction? Will it yield infinitely many primes? This approach illuminates how ontological intuitions shape mathematical reasoning.

One could reinterpret Kant in light of 19th-20th century refutations. Kant’s "intuitions" might reflect our cognitive apparatus; a sufficiently abstract system could still be conceived by a human mind, albeit with difficulty. Acknowledging space and time as our forms of intuition does not logically preclude other geometrical systems—it only shows they are less directly given to ordinary sensibility. Historically, however, new mathematical practice encouraged the conclusion that mathematical reality transcends human cognition. By the early 20th century, Frege, Hilbert, and Gödel asserted that mathematical practice only makes sense assuming a human-independent ontology. This non-anthropomorphic Platonism—the full de-psychologization of mathematics—dominates the philosophical landscape. **Modern mathematics builds on this legacy while attempting to sidestep its ontological weight. This paper argues that the weight remains, and it shapes practice in ways that demand scrutiny.**

### Scope and Contribution of This Paper

This paper presents CPNF as a case study in how ontological commitments shape mathematical practice. Specifically, we will:

1.  Formally develop the Computational Prime Number Framework, treating primality as a certification process.
2.  Extend the framework to twin primes, reformulating infinitude as process non-termination.
3.  Introduce the key technical mechanism—the fixed-modulus reduction—and show the twin-prime certification process cannot terminate or stagnate.
4.  Argue this approach's effectiveness depends on its constructive, process-oriented ontology.

We do not claim to resolve the classical twin prime conjecture. We show that when the problem is reframed within a procedural ontology, the question of infinitude becomes coherent and tractable in a way unavailable under object-oriented formulations.

Rigorous formal proofs are outside this paper's scope. The proofs herein are delineated for logical correctness but not presented in full detail, as this is a philosophical paper.

The broader implication is methodological. If mathematical practice is sensitive to ontological framing, other long-standing problems may benefit from explicit philosophical reflection. Recovering a constructive conception of mathematics—rooted in procedures, certification, and finite operations—may regain neglected proof strategies and a more coherent account of mathematical knowledge itself.

In this view, mathematics emerges not as the study of a mind-independent realm we somehow apprehend, but as the disciplined exploration of what structured human reasoning necessarily entails. Reclaiming this perspective may clarify the power and limits of mathematical knowledge, restoring its status as the most refined expression of human rational activity.
